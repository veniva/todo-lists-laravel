# todo-lists-laravel
A demo project using Laravel 5  
  
It is inspired by the tutorial application development on Laravel's documentation website, but is more advanced sample.  
  
The App currently has the followind capabilities:  
- create / edit / delete TODO lists  
- create / edit / delete tasks within a given TODO list  
- the tasks are paginated in sets of 15 per page  
- multiple user support: every user can only view it's own lists & tasks
  
The layout is responsive with mobile-like side menu for screens smaller than 750px
  
On the client side I have used:  
- twitter bootstrap  
- jQuery  
- jRespond.js  
- jPanelMenu
